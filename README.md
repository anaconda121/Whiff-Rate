# Whiff Rate

## Program Objective: 
Determine what physical properties of baseball pitches thrown as strikes increase likelihood of resulting in a swing-and-a-miss: for example, how much it breaks, where it is thrown, how hard it is thrown, etc.

## Timeline:
<br> 
1. EDA- 5/5
2. Preprocessing- 5/8
3. First try at modelling- 5/15
4. Validation- 5/20
5. Improve your model- 5/24
6. Testing your model- 5/27
7. Presenting results- 5/27 <br>
## Concepts needed:
Linear regression
Logistic regression
Decision tree
Gradient boosting
Splitting data for training/testing/validation
EDA with pandas and feature engineering
We are going to mostly use concepts we learned from class.
