# Whiff Rate

## Program Objective: 
Determine what physical properties of baseball pitches thrown as strikes increase likelihood of resulting in a swing-and-a-miss: for example, how much it breaks, where it is thrown, how hard it is thrown, etc.

## Timeline:
<br> 
1. EDA- 5/5 Finished: 5/12 <br>
2. Preprocessing- 5/8 Finished: 5/12 <br>
3. First try at modelling- 5/15 <br>
4. Validation- 5/20 <br> 
5. Improve your model- 5/24 <br>
6. Testing your model- 5/27 <br>
7. Presenting results- 5/27 <br>

## Concepts needed:
<br>
1. Linear regression <br>
2. Logistic regression <br>
3. Decision tree <br>
4. Gradient boosting <br>
5. Splitting data for training/testing/validation <br>
6. EDA with pandas and feature engineering <br>

We are going to mostly use concepts we learned from class.
